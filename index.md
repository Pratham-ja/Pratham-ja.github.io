I am an individual researcher interested in **Deep Learning**, with a particular focus on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**.

My primary motivation is to understand *how* and *why* modern learning systems work. I spend a significant amount of time reading research papers, re-implementing ideas from scratch, and building intuition through hands-on experimentation.

This website serves as a public research notebook where I:
- write blogs explaining research papers in accessible language  
- document my own implementations and experiments  
- share ideas and questions that emerge while studying deep learning systems  

Much of the content here is written while learning and exploring, and reflects my current understanding at the time.

I use this portfolio to demonstrate my research interests and technical depth while applying for **research internships**, **academic research programs**, and **AI research roles** at frontier labs and industry research groups.

The views expressed on this site are my own and do not represent those of any organization.
